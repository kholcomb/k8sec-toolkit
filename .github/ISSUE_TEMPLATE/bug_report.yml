        ### For Claude Code Investigation
        
        **Key Components Involved:**
        - Scanner: [trivy/kubescape/etc]
        - Module: [internal/tools/x.go]
        - Function: [specific function if known]
        
        **Error Pattern:**
        - Error type: [timeout/parsing/validation/etc]
        - Frequency: [always/sometimes/specific conditions]
        
        **Investigation Starting Points:**
        - Log level to enable: `--verbose`
        - Files to examine first: 
        - Related issues: #
        
        **Security Considerations:**
        - Does this affect security scanning accuracy?
        - Could this be exploited?
        - Are credentials involved?
