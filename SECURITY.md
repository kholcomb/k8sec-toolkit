# KubeSec Security Documentation

## Security Architecture

KubeSec implements defense-in-depth security measures to protect against various attack vectors while orchestrating external security tools.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Secure Command Execution Framework

**Problem**: Traditional `exec.Command` calls can be vulnerable to command injection attacks.

**Solution**: Implemented `SecureExecutor` in `internal/security/executor.go` with:

- **Command Allowlisting**: Only pre-approved commands can be executed
- **Argument Validation**: All arguments validated against strict regex patterns
- **Binary Path Validation**: Only known, validated binary paths allowed
- **No Shell Interpretation**: Direct process execution without shell
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All command executions logged with security context

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Implemented in**:
- `internal/tools/kubescape.go` - Namespace, context, and framework validation
- `internal/tools/trivy.go` - Severity, path, and timeout validation
- `internal/security/executor.go` - Comprehensive argument pattern matching

**Validation includes**:
- Kubernetes resource name patterns (RFC 1123 compliant)
- Path sanitization with `filepath.Clean`
- Length limits (namespaces: 63 chars, contexts: 253 chars)
- Character allowlists for all user inputs

### 3. Binary Security

**Path Validation**:
- Absolute path requirements
- Allowlisted binary names only (`trivy`, `kubescape`)
- File existence and permission verification
- Protection against path traversal attacks

**Runtime Checks**:
- Binary integrity verification
- Executable permission validation
- Regular file type verification
- TODO: Cryptographic checksum verification (production)

### 4. Privilege Minimization

**Process Isolation**:
- Empty environment variables for subprocess execution
- Timeout controls for all external commands
- No elevated privileges required
- Fail-safe defaults (deny-by-default)

### 5. Audit and Monitoring

**Security Audit Trail**:
- All command executions logged with `SECURITY_AUDIT` prefix
- Command approval/denial decisions logged
- Execution time and result tracking
- Structured logging for SIEM integration

**Log Format**:
```
SECURITY_AUDIT: Command execution requested - Key: [command], Args: [args]
SECURITY_AUDIT: [APPROVED|DENIED] - [reason]
SECURITY_AUDIT: Executing validated command - [binary] [args]
SECURITY_AUDIT: Command completed [successfully|with error] - Duration: [time]
```

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

1. **Command Injection** - Eliminated through allowlisting and validation
2. **Path Traversal** - Prevented by absolute path requirements and cleaning
3. **Binary Substitution** - Mitigated by path validation and integrity checks
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Prevented by minimal privilege execution
5. **Resource Exhaustion** - Limited by timeouts and process controls

### Attack Vectors Considered

1. **Malicious Input**: User-provided namespaces, contexts, configurations
2. **Environment Manipulation**: PATH, environment variable attacks
3. **Binary Replacement**: Replacing legitimate tools with malicious ones
4. **Configuration Tampering**: Malicious kubeconfig or tool configurations

## Security Testing

### Unit Tests
- Input validation boundary testing
- Path traversal attempt testing
- Malformed input handling
- Timeout and resource limit testing

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end security workflow validation
- Tool integration security verification
- Audit trail completeness testing
- Error handling security verification

### Security Scanning
- Static analysis with security-focused linters
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Binary security verification
- Container security scanning (when containerized)

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead**:
1. Email security issues to: [security@kubesec.io]
2. Include detailed reproduction steps
3. Provide impact assessment
4. Include suggested mitigations if known

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
3. **Fix Development**: Target 7-14 days
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: After fix verification

### Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published at:
- Project security documentation
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Relevant security mailing lists

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review Requirements

All code changes require:
- Security-focused code review
- Input validation verification
- Privilege escalation assessment
- Audit trail impact analysis

### Pre-commit Security Checks

Automated security checks include:
- Static analysis with security rules
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection scanning
- Configuration security validation

### Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning integration
- Minimal dependency principle
- Vetted dependency sources only

## Production Deployment Security

### Recommended Configurations

1. **File System**:
   - Read-only root filesystem
   - Dedicated directory for tools with restricted permissions
   - No world-writable directories

2. **Network**:
   - Minimal network access (Kubernetes API only)
   - Outbound connection restrictions
   - TLS verification for all connections

3. **Runtime**:
   - Non-root user execution
   - Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Process monitoring and alerting

### Security Monitoring

Recommended monitoring:
- Command execution patterns
- Unusual binary access attempts
- Failed validation attempts
- Resource usage anomalies
- Network connection patterns

## Security Compliance

KubeSec security measures align with:
- **OWASP Top 10** - Input validation, injection prevention
- **CIS Security Guidelines** - Secure configuration practices
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Defense-in-depth implementation
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Security monitoring and audit requirements

## Continuous Security Improvement

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Binary Verification**:
   - Cryptographic signature verification
   - Hash-based integrity checking
   - Trusted publisher validation

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Real-time security event streaming
   - Machine learning anomaly detection
   - Integration with security platforms

3. **Advanced Isolation**:
   - Container-based tool execution
   - Namespace isolation for processes
   - Capability-based security model

### Security Research

Active research areas:
- Zero-trust security architecture
- Hardware security module integration
- Formal verification of security properties
- Quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms
