# K8Sec Toolkit Executive Dashboard Integration

## 🎯 Overview

The K8Sec Toolkit now provides enterprise-ready executive dashboard integration capabilities, transforming raw security findings into actionable business intelligence for C-level executives and security teams.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Executive Summary Data Model

- **ExecutiveSummary**: Comprehensive high-level security insights
- **TopRisk**: Prioritized risks with business impact assessment
- **CriticalAsset**: High-value assets requiring immediate attention
- **ActionItem**: Structured remediation plans with effort estimation

#### 2. Advanced Risk Scoring Algorithm

- Multi-factor risk calculation considering:
  - Severity weights (CRITICAL: 10.0, HIGH: 7.5, MEDIUM: 5.0, LOW: 2.5, INFO: 1.0)
  - Asset criticality (Secret: 1.4x, Ingress: 1.3x, Deployment: 1.2x)
  - Exposure multiplier (1.5x for internet-exposed resources)
  - CVSS bonus for vulnerabilities
  - Age decay factor (0.95 daily decay)

#### 3. CVSS Business Impact System

- Industry-standard CVSS 3.1 compatible scoring
- Organizational customization with environmental metrics:
  - Business Function (Supporting → Mission Critical)
  - Data Classification (Public → Restricted)
  - Compliance Requirements (None → Regulated)
  - Business Continuity (Low → Critical)
- Vector string format for interoperability

#### 4. Business Impact Analysis

- Critical asset identification with business context
- Data classification inference (PII, PCI, PHI, Confidential)
- Business function mapping (API Services, Data Storage, Financial Services)
- Actionable remediation planning (Immediate, Quick Wins, Long-term)

## 🚀 Demo Results
